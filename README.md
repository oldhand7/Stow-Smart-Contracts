# Overview
## Stow Users
A contract that keeps a registry of registered users and their provenance.

## Stow Records
A contract that keeps a registry of metadata of uploaded medical records, as well as the IRIS score of those records. The metadata makes records easily searchable.

# Recieving Tokens when adding Stow records

When a person uploads data, 1 Finney STOW token is transferred from the Stow admin pool/acct to the userâ€™s address.
Currently no data validation needed.

1 Finney of STOW tokens per upload for now.

## Stow Permissions
A contract that keeps a registry of permissions. Permissions include who can view what data, and where the permissioned copy is stored on IPFS.
